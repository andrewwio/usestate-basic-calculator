ISSUES:
1. integer then operation then equals should be previousState operation currentState (currently it is 0 operation currentState)
[complete] 2. Add 0 to "." so that it displays '0.' instead of just '.'
[complete] 3. add commas
4. percent and negate then equals displaying '' instead of '0'
[complete] 5. leading zeros. Pressing 0 first makes it display in front of the other digits ie '023' instead of '23'
[complete] 6. AC displaying '' instead of '0'
[complete] 7. Hover and focus buttons with white fadeout transition (css)
8. limit integers to 9 (use toFixed(9) on numbers or substring(0, 9) on strings)
9. progressively make font smaller

SOLUTIONS:
1. 
2. Used documented formatter
3. Used documented formatter
4. 
5. Tried using some functions and methods to drop the leading zero but the answer was to experiment with resetting certain variables and not others
6. Changed {input} to a messy elseif ternary operator that handles the input and/or previousState then changed ternary operator into a normal function
7. Experimenting until I found the right transition
8. 
9. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
